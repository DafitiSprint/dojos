# Time Complexity Problems

## Frog Jump

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

    int solution(int X, int Y, int D); 

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:

  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30

the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

        after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
        after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
        after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Assume that:

        X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        X â‰¤ Y.

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).


## Perm Missing Element

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

       int solution(int A[], int N);

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

        A[1] = 3
        A[0] = 2
        A[2] = 1
        A[3] = 5

the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        the elements of A are all distinct;
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
